## Lesson 1: The basics

#### Defining our tools

[__Python__ is a high-level coding language](https://www.python.org/). There are many languages (Ruby, Javascript, PHP), but Python is nice because you can use it to quickly build projects large and small. It has a massive community that builds and maintains __libraries__ of code that extends python's core functionality. You can run python code as executable files or in the Python shell.

The __command line__, accessible in Mac through Terminal or PC through PowerShell, is an interface designed to execute code without a graphical user interface. It's extremely powerful and can be used to chew through complex tasks much faster than through traditional point-and-click software.

__[Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/)__ is a text-editor with nice capabalilites like __syntax highlighting__ which can give you clues about the formatting of your code specific to the language you're using. We'll be using Sublime for this workshop, but feel free to explore other text editor options.

__[Github](https://github.com/)__ is a Web-based service built on git, an industry standard system used to manage code and software. It's centered around the idea of __version control__, allowing multiple collaborators to contribute to a code base. Project managers can accept or reject these changes, branch the code in different directions or revert to old versions in case of disaster.

An __API__, or application programming interface, is a system that allows you to easily interact with a third-party's data (or your own, if it's an in-house API). They are typically designed so you can programatically query for specific types of data through requests structured like URLs. For this workshop, we'll be using a Python library that makes using the Twitter API really easy.

A __server__ is just a computer that's going to do whatever we say. It might be remote, like ones we use through [Amazon Web Services](http://aws.amazon.com/), or it could be local on our own machine. Running a remote server for code is nice because it doesn't require you to keep your personal or work machine on all the time.

__Got all that?__
